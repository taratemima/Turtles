# Turtles
Various codes I played with in Python Turtles
I created a multiple shapes through the Joy of Coding. I used code from Geeks For Geeks for spirals for two of them. I follow instructions for another Spiral program through Joy of Coding. This is intended for future employers, to see what I can do.
